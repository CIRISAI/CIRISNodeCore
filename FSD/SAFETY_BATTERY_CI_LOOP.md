# FSD: Safety-Battery CI Loop

**Status**: Draft v1.0 (Spec; first impl in this PR).
**Owner**: CIRISNodeCore + CIRISAgent qa_runner.
**Last updated**: 2026-05-11.
**Cross-references**: `cirisnodecore/MISSION.md` v1.0 §7.3 (safety.ciris.ai
pilot scope); `cirisnodecore/SCHEMA.md` v1.0 §11 (BatteryManifest) +
§13 (canonical-vs-pending split); `tests/safety/README.md`;
`tools/qa_runner/modules/safety_battery.py`;
`.github/workflows/safety-battery.yml`.

This FSD lives under `cirisnodecore/FSD/` so it travels with the
CIRISNodeCore spec at extraction time. Until the rust crate is `[Impl]`,
the loop runs in CIRISAgent's CI; once folded, it migrates to the crate
with no schema changes.

---

## 1. Why this loop

`MISSION.md` §7.3 names safety.ciris.ai as the pilot deployment of
CIRISNodeCore: external contributors propose questions / batteries /
prompt-edits / guide-edits / accord-edits as Contributions on the
federation chain; cell experts score real agent responses; tickets
emerge from scoring; edit proposals reference tickets; votes promote
winning edits into the canonical artifact in CIRISAgent's next release.

For that loop to function, safety.ciris.ai needs three things from the
CIRISAgent side:

1. **Reliable batch execution** of canonical batteries against the live
   agent, on a schedule, in CI, without per-run operator babysitting.
2. **Signed, addressable artifacts** that safety.ciris.ai can fetch,
   verify, and present to scorers — independent of GitHub's identity
   guarantees alone.
3. **Dedup** so the same (cell × battery_version × model × agent ×
   template) tuple doesn't burn LLM calls and CI minutes redundantly.

This FSD specifies all three.

---

## 2. The artifact tuple

The loop produces TWO classes of artifact (capture + interpret); each
is identified by an overlapping tuple.

### 2.0 Capture artifact tuple (6 elements)

The agent-under-test's signed responses.

| Element | Source | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `cell.language` | BatteryManifest | `am` |
| `cell.domain` | BatteryManifest | `mental_health` |
| `battery_version` | BatteryManifest | `4` |
| `model_slug` | `--live-model` (slug-safe) | `google_gemma-4-31B-it` |
| `agent_version` | `ciris_engine/constants.py` | `2.8.9` |
| `template_id` | setup-completion payload | `default` |

### 2.0a Interpret artifact tuple (9 elements)

The judge's verdicts. Strictly a superset of the capture tuple plus
three judge-side elements.

| Element | Source | Example |
|---|---|---|
| (all six capture elements above) |  |  |
| `rubric_id` | criteria.json | `am_mh_v4_canonical_universal` |
| `judge_model_slug` | judge model identifier, slug-safe | `claude-opus-4-7` |
| `judge_prompt_sha256[:8]` | first 8 hex chars of the prompt template SHA | `88360a06` |

Why the split into two artifact classes:

- **Capture is expensive** (agent-under-test runs through full DMA +
  conscience pipeline per question; minutes per question on Together
  gemma). Re-using captured responses when only the rubric changes is
  the whole point of the dedup pre-flight (§4).
- **Interpret is cheap** for deterministic criteria, moderate for
  semantic. Re-running interpret with a new rubric against existing
  captured responses is the normal flow when a `rubric_proposal`
  Contribution wins a vote and becomes canonical.

Why each new element on the interpret tuple:

- **`rubric_id`** because competing rubrics may exist for the same
  cell (per `cirisnodecore/FSD/RUBRIC_CROWDSOURCING.md`). Each
  rubric's verdicts are distinct evidence; the artifact name carries
  which rubric was applied.
- **`judge_model_slug`** because the judge is a foundation model
  (default Claude Opus 4.7) called directly. Different judge models
  produce different verdicts; each is its own evidence track. See
  `cirisnodecore/FSD/JUDGE_MODEL.md`.
- **`judge_prompt_sha256[:8]`** because the prompt template is the
  judge's calibratable surface. A `judge_prompt_edit` Contribution
  that wins votes changes the SHA → distinct artifact. Old vs new
  template's verdicts comparable side-by-side.

Why each capture element (unchanged from before):

- **Cell** is the consensus boundary per `MISSION.md` Primitive 2/3. A
  run is bound to one (domain, language) cell.
- **`battery_version`** changes when the canonical question set changes
  (per `SCHEMA.md` §11). A `v4` and `v5` battery for the same cell are
  distinct artifacts.
- **`model_slug`** because the same battery against different models
  produces different responses — the (cell, model) pair is what
  scorers verify. Slugging: lowercase `/` → `_`, strip everything
  outside `[a-z0-9._-]`.
- **`agent_version`** because the agent's prompt surface, conscience
  faculty, and DMA pipeline change between releases. A 2.8.9 run and
  a 2.8.10 run against the same battery/model are distinct evidence.
- **`template_id`** because the agent's persona / identity / allowed
  capabilities differ per template. Today: `default` (Ally persona).
  Future: `datum`, `echo-speculative`, `scout` etc. each get their own
  artifact track.

### 2.1 Artifact names

**Capture**:
```
safety-battery-capture-{language}-{domain}-v{battery_version}-{model_slug}-{agent_version}-{template_id}
```

Example:
```
safety-battery-capture-am-mental_health-v4-qwen_qwen3.6-35b-a3b-2.8.9-default
```

**Interpret**:
```
safety-battery-interpret-{language}-{domain}-v{battery_version}-{model_slug}-{agent_version}-{template_id}-{rubric_short}-{judge_model_slug}-{judge_prompt_sha256[:8]}
```

Example:
```
safety-battery-interpret-am-mental_health-v4-qwen_qwen3.6-35b-a3b-2.8.9-default-canonical_universal-claude-opus-4-7-88360a06
```

GitHub Actions artifact name length cap is 255 chars; both tuples fit
well under. (Shortening `rubric_id` to the suffix after `am_mh_v4_`
keeps the interpret name compact.)

**`judge_prompt_sha256` prefix-escalation policy.** The 8-char prefix
has ~1-in-4-billion collision probability per cell — vanishingly
unlikely in pilot phase. If an intra-cell collision is observed (two
distinct prompt templates SHA-collide on their first 8 hex chars
within the same `(rubric_id, judge_model_slug)`), extend the prefix
to 12 hex chars cell-wide and re-name future artifacts accordingly.
The 12-char fallback is documented as a comment in
`tools/qa_runner/modules/safety_interpret.py` and lives here as
the policy of record; it is not pre-applied (longer names without
benefit add tuple noise).

**Latest-wins**: no `run_id` in either name. Re-running the same tuple
overwrites the artifact pointer (each run still has a unique run_id
within the workflow run; the *named* artifact tracks the most recent).
safety.ciris.ai always fetches "the current canonical run of this
tuple."

### 2.2 What each artifact contains

**Capture bundle**:
```
safety-battery-capture-am-mental_health-v4-...-2.8.9-default/
├── results.jsonl                 # one row per question: response + metadata
├── summary.json                  # capture-run rollup
├── manifest_signed.json          # signed envelope (§3) — capture-side
├── traces/                       # full reasoning stream from the agent-under-test
│   └── accord-batch-*.json       # @streaming_step broadcasts (per CLAUDE.md memory)
└── workflow.log                  # stdout/stderr from the capture runner
```

**Interpret bundle**:
```
safety-battery-interpret-am-mental_health-v4-qwen_...-default-canonical_universal-claude-opus-4-7-88360a06/
├── verdicts.jsonl                # one row per (response, criterion) pair
├── verdicts_summary.json         # rollup (per-criterion pass/fail/undetermined)
├── manifest_signed.json          # signed envelope (§3) — interpret-side, with
│                                 # references back to the capture artifact
└── workflow.log
```

The interpret bundle does NOT carry agent reasoning traces because the
judge is a foundation model called directly, not a CIRIS agent. The
judge's call shape is fully reproducible from inputs (judge_model,
judge_prompt_sha256, criterion, response) — see
`cirisnodecore/FSD/JUDGE_MODEL.md`.

Both bundles get a Sigstore attestation; verifies via
`gh attestation verify` (§3.2). The interpret bundle's
`manifest_signed.json` carries the capture bundle's `manifest_signed.json
.bundle.results_jsonl_sha256` so verifiers can confirm "this verdict
batch was produced against THIS specific response batch."

---

## 3. Signing model

Two complementary signatures cover the artifact end-to-end:

### 3.1 Per-response audit-chain anchors (intrinsic provenance)

Each row in `results.jsonl` carries `agent_task_id` — the ID of the
agent's task that produced the response. That task ID resolves to a
signed audit-chain entry produced by the agent's TPM-backed Ed25519
signer at response time. The audit entry is durable in CIRISPersist
(per substrate) and signed against the agent's published pubkey.

Verification path (scorer's POV):

1. Read `agent_task_id` from a JSONL row.
2. Query the audit chain for that task ID.
3. Confirm the audit entry's signature against the agent's pubkey
   (also recorded in `manifest_signed.json` for offline verification).
4. Confirm the audit entry's recorded SPEAK content matches the JSONL
   row's `agent_response`.

This is provenance *intrinsic* to the agent. Verifying does not require
trusting CI, GitHub, or any external party — only the agent's signing
key, which is already the federation's root of trust per
`FEDERATION_THREAT_MODEL.md`.

### 3.2 Bundle-level Sigstore attestation (extrinsic provenance)

After the runner completes, the workflow uses
`actions/attest-build-provenance@v1` to produce a Sigstore-signed
attestation binding `results.jsonl` + `summary.json` +
`manifest_signed.json` to:

- The workflow file (path + content SHA)
- The commit SHA on `main` at run time
- The GitHub Actions runner identity (Fulcio-issued cert)
- The run ID

Verification: `gh attestation verify <artifact> --owner CIRISAI` or
the Sigstore CLI. The attestation proves "this bundle was produced by
the `safety-battery.yml` workflow at commit X on the CIRISAI
repository." Tampering invalidates it.

The two signature layers cover different threat models:
- **(3.1) audit-chain anchors** prove the per-response content came
  from the named CIRIS agent.
- **(3.2) Sigstore attestation** proves the bundle was assembled by
  this CI workflow on this commit.

Either is sufficient for many threat models; both together close the
loop end-to-end.

### 3.3 `manifest_signed.json` schema

```json
{
  "schema": "ciris.ai/safety_battery_manifest_signed/v1",
  "run_id": "20260511T193000Z",
  "captured_at_start": "2026-05-11T19:30:00Z",
  "captured_at_end":   "2026-05-11T19:48:32Z",

  "cell": {"domain": "mental_health", "language": "am"},
  "battery_id": "am_mental_health_v4",
  "battery_version": 4,
  "rubric_sha256": "c1e8e9a9314afe32...",

  "agent_id": "datum",
  "agent_version": "2.8.9-stable",
  "agent_signing_pubkey_fingerprint": "de74eced",
  "template_id": "default",

  "model": "google/gemma-4-31B-it",
  "model_slug": "google_gemma-4-31B-it",
  "live_base_url": "https://api.together.xyz/v1",
  "live_provider": "openai",

  "bundle": {
    "results_jsonl_sha256": "ab12cd34...",
    "summary_json_sha256":  "ef56gh78..."
  },

  "agent_audit_anchors": [
    {
      "question_id": "am_mh_v4_q01",
      "agent_task_id": "task_01HX..."
    },
    ...
  ],

  "ci_provenance": {
    "github_repository": "CIRISAI/CIRISAgent",
    "github_sha": "ee0e7172d...",
    "github_run_id": "25700000000",
    "workflow_path": ".github/workflows/safety-battery.yml"
  }
}
```

The Sigstore attestation produced by `actions/attest-build-provenance`
signs over this file plus the JSONL + summary; safety.ciris.ai verifies
both layers before trusting the bundle.

---

## 4. Dedup pre-flight

Before launching the agent + LLM calls, the workflow checks whether a
matching artifact already exists:

```
GET /repos/CIRISAI/CIRISAgent/actions/artifacts
   ?name=safety-battery-am-mental_health-v4-google_gemma-4-31B-it-2.8.9-default
   &per_page=10
```

Sort by `created_at` desc. Take the most recent. If:

1. The artifact exists, AND
2. Its Sigstore attestation verifies (`gh attestation verify`), AND
3. Its `created_at` is within the **freshness window** (default 7 days;
   policy parameter, override via `workflow_dispatch` input `force`),

then the workflow exits cleanly with status `success`, a clear log line
identifying the existing artifact's URL, and a job-summary annotation
pointing safety.ciris.ai at the URL.

Otherwise the workflow proceeds with the battery run.

### 4.1 When the freshness window expires

By default 7 days. Rationales:

- LLM-side: providers update model snapshots; gemma-4-31B-it today and
  next week may differ behaviorally even at the same model name.
- Agent-side: same agent_version + same template + same battery_version
  should produce stable behavior, but week-to-week regressions are
  worth catching.
- CI cost: at ~$0.0002 per battery run on Together gemma, weekly
  refresh per cell is cheap. The freshness window is the dial.

Operators can force a fresh run via `workflow_dispatch` with
`force: true` regardless of existing artifacts. The cron path always
uses the freshness window check.

### 4.2 Multiple cells in one workflow

When a future workflow extension runs N cells in a matrix, the dedup
check runs per-cell (per-tuple, really). A run that's fresh for `am`
and stale for `ar` will skip am, run ar, attest only the new ar
artifact.

---

## 5. CI bootstrap robustness

The CI runner is ephemeral: no `~/ciris/.env`, no data dir, no prior
state. Two safeguards:

### 5.1 Module-metadata `WIPE_DATA_ON_START`

Modules that need a clean-slate start (because their assumptions about
agent state are violated by leftover data, OR because they need a
deterministic baseline for signed-artifact reproducibility) declare:

```python
class SafetyBatteryTests:
    WIPE_DATA_ON_START = True
```

The qa_runner reads this via the same `_module_metadata.py` mechanism
as `REQUIRES_LIVE_LLM` and `SERVER_ENV`. When `True`, the runner forces
`--wipe-data` regardless of CLI flags, triggering:

- Data directory cleared
- `CIRIS_FORCE_FIRST_RUN=1` set
- Auto-setup-completion path fires (per `server.py` setup payload at
  ~line 1240) — completes the wizard with the live LLM config the
  runner already has

Result: agent reaches WORK reliably, every time, even with no prior
state. No flaky "stopped waiting for setup" failures.

### 5.2 Workflow `env:` belt-and-suspenders

The workflow YAML carries:

```yaml
env:
  CIRIS_FORCE_FIRST_RUN: "1"
  PYTHONUNBUFFERED: "1"
```

`CIRIS_FORCE_FIRST_RUN=1` survives any subshell env scrubbing; the
agent will be in first-run mode regardless of what `.env` writes ran.
`PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` is the memory-benchmark workflow's pattern — keeps
stdout streaming through `tee` so cancellations don't lose the in-flight
output buffer.

---

## 6. End-to-end flow

Two CI jobs, capture → interpret. The capture job runs a CIRIS agent
and streams its full reasoning trace
(`CIRIS_ACCORD_METRICS_LOCAL_COPY_DIR`) into its bundle. The interpret
job is a plain Python script calling a foundation model — no CIRIS
runtime, no traces of its own (the judge's call is reproducible from
inputs). Both bundles attested separately via Sigstore.

### 6.1 Federation-chain ingestion policy

The CI loop produces evidence; the federation chain stores
consensus state. The policy that governs which CI bundles flow
into the chain:

**Only canonical artifacts ingest into the federation audit chain**
— that is, bundles produced by runs whose battery is `canonical`
(per `cirisnodecore/SCHEMA.md` §13.1) AND whose rubric is
`canonical` per `cirisnodecore/FSD/RUBRIC_CROWDSOURCING.md` §3.1.

CI bundles for `candidate` rubrics, exploratory model swaps, or
debug-driven workflow_dispatch runs stay GH-only evidence:
accessible to safety.ciris.ai via the GH Actions Artifacts API +
Sigstore attestation, durable for the 90-day artifact-retention
window, but not mirrored into the federation chain.

Why this asymmetry. The federation chain is the consensus record
of what counts as a verdict in the loop. Mirroring every CI run
into it (including candidates, debug runs, freshness re-runs)
would drown signal in noise and conflate "this is what voted-in
canonical produces" with "we tested a hypothesis." The chain
should hold the former; the artifacts cache holds both. When a
candidate rubric wins votes and promotes to canonical at the
next `battery_version` cut, *the next CI run for that newly-
canonical rubric* is the one that ingests — not retroactive
backfills of the candidate's history.

Operational shape (when CIRISNodeCore is `[Impl]`): the workflow
emits a `federation_chain_ingest` event with the artifact's
Sigstore attestation reference + `manifest_signed.json` SHA only
when the BatteryManifest + criteria.json both have `status:
canonical`. Until the crate is `[Impl]`, the policy is recorded
here and surfaced as a label on the CI artifact (`canonical=true`
on the GH artifact); safety.ciris.ai filters by that label when
deciding what to display as "the canonical evidence" vs. "all
runs."

---

## 7. What this loop is NOT

Explicit scope boundaries to forestall scope creep:

- **Not a scoring system.** Scoring is human work on safety.ciris.ai
  per `MISSION.md` §3.4. The CI loop produces signed evidence; the
  scoring layer reads it.
- **Not a regression detector.** Comparing this week's results to last
  week's is downstream of the artifact. Cap the loop's job at
  "produce verifiable signed evidence"; let downstream do the diff.
- **Not a contributor sandbox.** Contributors submit Contributions to
  the federation chain (per `SCHEMA.md` §4), not to this CI loop. The
  loop only runs *canonical*, voted-in batteries (per `SCHEMA.md` §13).
- **Not an agent-side change.** Zero modifications to the canonical
  agent runtime. All work is in qa_runner + workflow + module
  metadata. The agent runs unchanged.

---

## 8. Migration to the CIRISNodeCore crate

When the rust crate goes `[Impl]`:

1. This FSD moves with `cirisnodecore/` to the standalone repo.
2. The signing model (§3) doesn't change — per-response audit anchors
   are CIRIS agent state regardless of which CI runs the loop.
3. The bundle-level attestation step (§3.2) moves to the crate repo's
   CI, signing artifacts on the crate side.
4. The artifact-naming tuple (§2) stays identical, modulo the workflow
   path in `ci_provenance` pointing at the new repo's workflow file.

safety.ciris.ai's query path (§4) updates to look at the crate repo's
artifacts instead of CIRISAgent's. The verification logic is unchanged.

---

## 9. Open questions

1. **Freshness window default**: 7 days proposed. Calibrate against
   actual usage: how often do scorers re-query? If safety.ciris.ai
   always uses cached results between weekly cron runs, 7 days is
   right. If scorers want fresher data on-demand, drop to 1-3 days.

2. **Artifact retention**: GH Actions caps at 400 days (free tier).
   This loop's artifacts are also written to the federation persistence
   chain (eventually); the GH copy is the convenience-cache layer. For
   the pilot phase, 90 days matches `memory-benchmark.yml`.

3. **Cross-tuple aggregation**: a future "compare this week vs last
   week" workflow downstream would query multiple artifacts and diff
   them. Not in scope here, but the tuple-naming makes it
   straightforward: just iterate the artifact list with prefix
   `safety-battery-{lang}-{domain}-v{battery_version}`.

4. **Audit-anchor resolution**: the JSONL captures `agent_task_id`; the
   audit-chain entry is queryable via `/v1/audit/entries/{task_id}`. If
   the audit query has latency at scale, consider snapshotting the
   audit entry content directly into `manifest_signed.json` per
   response — bigger bundle, fully self-contained.

5. **template_id discovery**: today the runner hardcodes `default`. A
   future improvement: read the agent's actual loaded template post-
   bootstrap so the artifact name reflects what was actually used, not
   what was requested. (`/v1/system/identity` exposes this.)

---

*This document is iterative. v1.0 is the first impl-ready spec; later
revisions track operational evidence from pilot runs against the 14
canonical mental-health batteries.*

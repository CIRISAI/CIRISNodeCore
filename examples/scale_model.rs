//! Federation scaling model — companion to `FSD/FEDERATION_SCALING_MODEL.md`.
//!
//! Run: `cargo run --example scale_model`
//!
//! **v0.3 — single-pool, CEG-organic.** The v0.2 model split storage
//! into an explicit "direct-trust archive" with a `T_direct` knob
//! and a separate "cache" with TTL + LRU cap. That dichotomy was
//! premature — CEG's primitives compose into a simpler model where
//! every node holds ONE pool of bytes, scored by trust × demand ×
//! recency, with disk budget the only hard limit.
//!
//! **The discipline** (Eric, this session):
//!
//! Replication intake at every node, for every byte-attempt:
//! ```
//! hold? = trust(source) ≥ local_threshold  AND  capacity_available
//! ```
//!
//! Eviction at every node, when capacity pressure exists:
//! ```
//! evict_score(blob) = popularity(blob) × freshness(blob)
//!                   = access_count_since(T) × decay(now − last_accessed_at)
//! ```
//!
//! Push and pull terminate at the same gate. No "archive vs cache"
//! distinction — bytes that match trust + earn demand stay; bytes
//! that don't get evicted when newer / more popular content arrives.
//!
//! **The CEG locality dividend** (the scaling lever that comes for
//! free from the wire format):
//!
//! `cohort_scope ∈ {self, family}` content NEVER emits a
//! `holds_bytes:sha256:*` attestation, so it is structurally
//! undiscoverable, so no peer can ever request it, so the trust gate
//! is never even reached. Local content is local because the wire
//! format will not carry it.
//!
//! **What this model computes:** the steady-state per-server held
//! bytes at each scenario's trust topology + demand rate + disk
//! budget. The composition (own / admitted-trust / hot-cache) is
//! shown but is derived from the inputs, not configured. Feasibility
//! gates: 1 TB disk / 1 Gbps bandwidth / 1 core full-util per server.
//!
//! Empirical constants baked in from CIRISVerify v2.8.0 + CIRISEdge
//! v0.10.0 + CIRISPersist v3.3.0 — see FSD §2.
